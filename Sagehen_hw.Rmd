# Part 1: Come up with a combined metric that you think is interesting 
See: combined metric file. We used equally weighted nse, rmse, and relerr.

# Part II Split Sample Calibration

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# multiple results - lets say we've run the model for multiple years, each column
# is streamflow for a different parameter set

msage$date = sager$date
msage$month = sager$month
msage$year = sager$year
msage$day = sager$day
msage$wy = sager$wy


# Transform data for analysis
msagel <- msage %>% pivot_longer(cols =!c(date, month, year, day, wy), names_to = "run", values_to = "flow")

# Split the data into pre and post calibration years; pre_calibration is 1970 to 1979; post is 1980 to 1989
pre_calibration <- subset(msage, wy >= 1970 & wy <= 1979) #subset for year between 1970 and 1979 #training dataset 
post_calibration <- subset(msage, wy >= 1980 & wy <= 1989) #subset for year between 1980 and 1989  #validation dataset 

##check out the pre_calibration graph
pre_calibration_graph=ggplot(subset(msagel, wy >= 1970 & wy <= 1979), aes(as.Date(date), flow, col=run))+geom_line()+theme(legend.position = "none") 

# lets add observed streamflow

# using our high flow statistics use apply to compute for all the data using the updated flow metrics routing that also computed combined metrics

res = pre_calibration %>% select(!c("date","month","year","day","wy")) %>% map_df(combined_function, o=sager$obs)

resl = res %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("V"), names_to="run", values_to="value") 

```


Find the best and worst parameter set, given your performance metric

```{r}

# extract best and worst runs
best_run <- resl[which.max(resl$value), ]
worst_run <-  resl[which.min(resl$value), ]

paste("Best run V_num:", best_run$run, " Best run value:", best_run$value)
paste("Worst run V_num:", worst_run$run, " Worst run value:", worst_run$value)
```

# validation step -- run the model with these parameters from V127 

```{r}
#the best parameter set for this performance metric was V130; 

ggplot(subset(msagel, run == "V127"), aes(x= date, flow)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Flow (mm/month)", title = "Monthly Aggregate Maximum Stream Flow for Best Model Run (V127)") + theme_minimal()

```


# Compute and plot how the performance of the model using the best parameter set changed in pre and post calibration periods


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#performance for pre calibration period
#performance for post calibration period 


# Compute combined metric for pre and post calibration for the best run
pre_combined_func <- combined_function(pre_calibration[["V127"]], sager$obs)
post_combined_func <- combined_function(post_calibration[["V127"]], sager$obs)

# Prep plot
both_combine <- data.frame(calibration = c("Pre", "Post"), combined = c(pre_combined_func, post_combined_func))

# Plot changes in combined metrics, pre & post calibration
ggplot(both_combine, aes(x = calibration, y = combined , fill = calibration)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + labs(title = "Model Performance Pre vs Post Calibration", x = "Calibration Period", y = "Combined Metric")

```


Write 2-3 sentences to explain your metric design and comment on model performance based on your metric

**All three metrics chosen to create the combined metric have different strengths in evaluating model performance, including errors within the model and model efficiency. We chose to weight nse, rmse, and relerr equally (1/3, 1/3, ~1/3). Based on the above results, the model performed slightly better  for the Pre-Calibration data (~0.29) compared to the Post-Calibration data (~0.3). This makes sense, as we noticed that the post calibration years had a lot more variation in their data than pre-calibration years. This may require further adjustments of the model to improve performance Post-Calibration results**
